## About

I can describe this as an exhausting experience.<br/>
Make monorepo with Strapi (with Graphql) – definitely a pain in an ass, but making it type-safe (typescript) is something on a spiritual level.<br/>
But the most pleasantly part – tweak/config everything (like seriously everything) to make it work with monorepo.<br/>
If I knew that before, I would go for the T3 stack: TypeScript, Next.js, tRPC, Prisma, Tailwind.

## Stack

**Core:** NX, Typescript;

**Front:** NextJS, Storybook, React Query, Jotai;

**Style:** Windicss (`clsx`*);<br/>
*lovely and faster alternative to `classnames`.

**Back:** Strapi with Graphql (`codegen`, `graphql-request`);

**Testing:** React Testing Library / Jest, Cypress.
